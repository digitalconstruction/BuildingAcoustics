The approach followed in model ontology is in line with the scope of the project towards extending the core BIM ontology with additional models that are of interest for specific business needs. A non-exhaustive list of entities is incorporated in the model, focusing on key concepts that are of interest in the project. The ontology uses the concepts defined in <a href="https://w3c-lbd-cg.github.io/bot/">BOT</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/">SSN</a>.</p>
